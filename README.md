# SafariBookmarkBackup

Currently the script only backups the bookmarks to iCloud Drive.

It will be updated to support other folders, and possibly present them as options, such as Dropbox, Google Drive, Box, and as last option, any folder of the user's choice.

In future version, would expand the function to cover other preference files in Mac OS.
