# SafariBookmarkBackup

This script is designed to deal with the repitive tasks of backup Safari Bookmarks and TopSites files, and name the backup files with the backup date for easy reference.

## Planning

It will be updated to support other folders, and possibly present them as options, such as Dropbox, Google Drive, Box, and as last option, any folder of the user's choice.

In future version, would expand the function to cover other preference files in Mac OS.

## Version History

v.1.0

Only backups the bookmarks to iCloud Drive.
